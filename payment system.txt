Architecture Planning

A. Payment Service Layer

Create a PaymentServiceProvider interface to make switching providers easier
Implement StripePaymentService that implements this interface
Use Repository pattern to handle payment records
Create payment-specific exceptions for better error handling

B. Database Changes

Add payment_provider column to orders table
Add payment_intent_id for Stripe reference
Add payment_method_details to store card info (last 4, brand)
Add payment_status timestamps (authorized_at, captured_at, refunded_at)
Create payment_transactions table for logging all attempts


Implementation Phases

Phase 1: Basic Integration

Set up Stripe SDK and credentials
Implement basic card payment flow
Add payment validation
Handle successful payments
Basic error handling
Update order status

Phase 2: Enhanced Features

Save cards for returning customers
Implement webhooks for async updates
Add payment retry logic
Handle partial refunds
Implement payment logging
Add payment analytics

Phase 3: Advanced Features

Multiple payment methods
Subscription handling
Payment splitting for marketplace
Advanced fraud detection
Currency conversion handling
Payment reporting


Key Considerations

Security:

PCI compliance requirements
