I'll help you design the checkout system based on your codebase. Let's analyze what you have and what needs to be added.

Let's break down what we need to build a complete checkout system:

1. Pre-Checkout Requirements:
- ✓ Cart Management (implemented)
- ✓ Customer Model (implemented)
- ✓ Address Model (implemented)
- ⚠ Inventory Management (partially implemented, needs order integration)
- ❌ Order Model (missing)
- ❌ OrderItem Model (missing)
- ❌ Order Status Management (missing)
- ❌ Order Number Generation (missing)
- ❌ Email Notifications System (missing)

2. Checkout Flow Steps:
a) Cart Review
- Display items, quantities, prices
- Allow quantity updates
- Show subtotal, total
- Future: tax, discounts

b) Customer Information
- Guest checkout option
- Login/Register option
- Email collection
- Marketing consent

c) Shipping Information
- Address collection
- Address validation
- Save address option
- Future: DHL integration placeholder

d) Payment Information
- Payment method selection
- Future: payment gateway integration
- Order summary
- Terms acceptance

e) Order Confirmation
- Order success page
- Email confirmation
- Account creation offer for guests

3. Required New Models:
```
Order
- order_number (unique)
- customer_id
- billing_address_id
- shipping_address_id
- status
- payment_status
- shipping_method
- subtotal
- shipping_cost
- total
- notes
- currency_code
- exchange_rate
- timestamps

OrderItem
- order_id
- purchasable_id
- purchasable_type
- quantity
- unit_price
- subtotal
- options (json)

OrderStatus (Enum)
- PENDING
- PROCESSING
- COMPLETED
- CANCELLED
- REFUNDED
- ON_HOLD

PaymentStatus (Enum)
- PENDING
- PAID
- FAILED
- REFUNDED
```

4. Required Services:
```
OrderService
- createOrder()
- updateOrderStatus()
- calculateTotals()
- generateOrderNumber()

CheckoutValidationService
- validateInventory()
- validateAddresses()
- validateCart()

OrderNotificationService
- sendOrderConfirmation()
- sendOrderStatusUpdate()
- sendShippingConfirmation()
```

5. Development Steps:

Phase 1: Foundation
1. Create Order and OrderItem models with migrations
2. Implement OrderStatus and PaymentStatus enums
3. Create basic OrderService
4. Set up order number generation

Phase 2: Checkout Flow
1. Create  checkout Livewire component
2. Implement cart review step
3. Build customer information collection
4. Add shipping address collection
5. Create order summary component

Phase 3: Order Processing
1. Implement order creation
2. Add inventory management integration
3. Set up basic email notifications
4. Create order confirmation page

Phase 4: Post-Order
1. Add order history to customer account
2. Implement order status management
3. Create order tracking page
4. Add guest order lookup

Phase 5: Future Integration Preparation
1. Add hooks for tax calculation
2. Prepare promotion code structure
3. Create shipping method interface
4. Set up payment gateway interface

Key Considerations:
1. Currency handling during checkout
2. Stock management during checkout process
3. Race conditions in inventory
4. Session handling
5. Security (XSS, CSRF)
6. Cart expiration
7. Failed checkout recovery
8. Performance optimization
9. Error handling
10. Logging for debugging
