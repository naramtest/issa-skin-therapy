I'll help you create a step-by-step implementation plan for Tabby payments based on the documentation. Here's a structured approach:
Phase 1: Initial Setup & Requirements

Obtain Tabby API Credentials


Get test API keys (Public & Secret) for development
Plan for production keys for later


Technical Requirements Assessment


Ensure website meets Tabby's requirements
Review supported currencies (AED, SAR, KWD)
Check supported countries (UAE, KSA, Kuwait)

Phase 2: Frontend Integration

Product/Cart Page Implementation


Add Tabby promo snippet
Implement split price messaging
Add "Learn more" widget integration


Checkout Page Design


Add Tabby as a payment method option
Implement payment method logo and text in English & Arabic
Add payment information display (4 installments breakdown)

Phase 3: Backend Integration

Pre-scoring Implementation

Setup webhook endpoints for payment status updates

Phase 4: Payment Processing

Payment Status Handling

Phase 5: Testing & Validation

Test Scenarios
